Project Journey

​I had a really hard time starting this project.  I wasn’t sure where to start.  So I started staring at a blank screen for way too long.  Then I started writing speedo-code,  what I was writing was not organized, I looked at some of the problems and broke them down from easiest to solve to the more complex.

Mistakes I made, and learned from:

* Not realizing that the project was an individual project but not a Scott figure this out by yourself project.  This one cost me a day!
* I did not write small amounts of code then test them.  Big mistake, spent more time debugging than I did writing.
* Not committing progress made.  Because I was committing on successful code there were not many commits because the code was a mess.  Lesson: going slow is faster.
* The biggest one was messing with the code given to us, this caused huge problems to the point where I had to go back to the original clone and migrate small amounts of code until I had a working engine.
* These were hard lessons that i will not be repeating.
